July Maptime is all about Git, Github, and how we can use these tools to collaborate on map projects. We'll cover the basics of using Github, and then dive into our first official Maptime MSP group project: an interactive welcome map for the attendees of NACIS 2015. We'll be in a new location this month: Highland Park Library in St. Paul. Due to library hours, we'll be starting our meeting 30 minutes earlier than usual: 5:30 - 7:30pm in the Community Room. We'll have pizza and refreshments, courtesy of CartoDB. As always, beginners are welcome and don't forget to bring a laptop.
