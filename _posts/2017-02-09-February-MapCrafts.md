We’ll be meeting at the **Department of Revenue's Stassen Building** in **St. Paul** over the lunch hour. The Stassen Building is on the green line, across the street from the [Robert Street Station](http://www.metrotransit.org/robert-street-station). Check out the [Department of Revenue's website](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/about_us/Pages/directions.aspx) for more detailed driving directions and parking information.

February's session is all about map crafts! We'll have Ashley Ignatius and Anne Morris show us some map crafts we can work through including: mapping using wood and string, constructing multi-purpose map boxes, and creating map beads!

After the short demo, we’ll have work time to make our own map crafts using the mediums Ashley and Anne show us, time for discussions with the group, sharing of projects, and all things maps!

We’ll have pizza and refreshments, courtesy of [CARTO](http://carto.com).

As always, beginners are welcome!
